# CSharpDesignPatterns
A Repository to practice and demonstrate proficiency with design patterns in C#

- Based on these design patterns https://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns
- I also learned about submodules based on these posts

## How to use
- Set a breakpoint at the first line of the program file for the design pattern to study and step into the program using f11. Make sure you have it set as the startup project by right clicking the program file. Have both the structural file and real world file open, along with the program file and the UML diagram.


## Frequency of use
### Creational Patterns
1. (5 of 5)**Abstract Factory** - Creates an instance of several families of classes
2. (2 of 5)Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
3. (5 of 5)**Factory Method** - Creates an instance of several derived classes
4. (3 of 5)Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
5. (4 of 5)Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural Patterns
1. (4 of 5)Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
2. (3 of 5)Bridge - Separates an object's interface from its implementation
3. (4 of 5)Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
4. (3 of 5)Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
5. (5 of 5)**Facade** - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
6. (1 of 5)Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
7. (4 of 5)Proxy - An object representing another object

### Behavioral Patterns
1. (2 of 5)Chain of Responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. (4 of 5)Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
3. (1 of 5)Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
4. (5 of 5)**Iterator** - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. (2 of 5)Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes
6. (1 of 5)Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. (5 of 5)**Observer** - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
8. (3 of 5)State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
9. (4 of 5)Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
10. (3 of 5)Template Method - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
11. (1 of 5)Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change
